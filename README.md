## What is **OpenWeatherMap**?
</br>
OpenWeatherMap is an online service, owned by OpenWeather Ltd, that provides global weather data, including current weather data, forecasts, nowcasts and historical data, utilising meteorological broadcast services and raw data from airport weather stations, radar stations and other weather stations.
</br>
Openweather NWP (numerical weather prediction) allows to calculate weather data for any location. We use proprietary convolutional neural network that collects and processes wide range of data sources to cover any location and consider the local nuances of climate. 

ML technology allows us to reach resolution about 500 m and very high accuracy between 90% and 100% with inaccuracy about 1%. Amongst data sources we feed to the NWP are 82,000 weather stations spread globally; national meteorological agencies (NOAA, Environment Canada, Met Office, etc.), radars, weather satellites.
